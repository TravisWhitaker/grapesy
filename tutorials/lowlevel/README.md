# Basics tutorial using the low-level API

See `/tutorials/basics` for the more direct `grapesy` translation of the
[official Basics tutorial](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/basics/).

In this tutorial we re-implement both the server and the client using the
low-level `grapesy` API (that is, without using the support for the Protobuf
communication patterns).
